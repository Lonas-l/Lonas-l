## About me :wave:

My QA journey has begun since 2021, it was hard at first, but every month I noticed that I liked it more and more. Despite the fact that I have held different positions in my experience (developer, CEO, whose responsibilities also included lead generation), I remain a supporter of testing. This process requires meticulousness, tenacity and unwavering attention to detail - all qualities that I possess. It's a complex process, but I get great satisfaction from understanding its intricacies.
