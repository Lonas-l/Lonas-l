## About me :wave:

My QA journey began in 2021. It was hard at first, but every month, I noticed that I liked it more and more. Even though I have held different positions in my experience, I remain a supporter of testing. This process requires meticulousness, tenacity, and unwavering attention to detail - all qualities I possess. It's a complex process, but I get great satisfaction from understanding its intricacies.
